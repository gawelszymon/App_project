Project "Main App NBA" is intended for busy people still interested in the most popular basketball league- NBA. 
My application presents relevent data and information associated with NBA in a comprehensive way. 
With a internet connection, you can know evrything current you need to now, with just two clicks. 

To make my app updated I used some functions shares by Jsoup library.
GUI is created through JavaFX. 
To make some simplifications, to make my project clear I used logging utility- Log4j.
